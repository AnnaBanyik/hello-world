The **Hello World** project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

**You will learn how to:** 

* Create and use a repository
* Start and manage a new branch
* Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
* Open and merge a pull request

# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like *repositories, branches, commits,* and *Pull Requests*. You’ll create your own **Hello World** repository and learn **GitHub’s Pull Request workflow**, a popular way to create and review code.

### No coding is necessary

To complete this tutorial, you need a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (the version control software GitHub is built on).

> Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

# Step 1. Create a Repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a _README_, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. _It also offers other common options such as a license file_.

Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

## To create a new repository

1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select **New repository**.
2. Name your repository `hello-world`.
3. Write a short desctiption.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a **README**.

Click **Create Repository**.

# Step 2. Create a Branch

**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`.

When you create a branch off the `master branch`, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of `master` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows

This diagram shows:

* The master branch
* A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
* The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into master

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like this?

* `story.txt`
* `story-joe-edit.txt`
* `story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt`
